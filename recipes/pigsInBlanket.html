    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For these sausage pigs in a blanket, skip the maple-flavored sausage and wrap sausage links in cinnamon rolls
        instead. You're welcome! You'll end up with 2 extra rolls so you can either slap them on the baking sheet or add
        4 extra sausage links to the mix, as you choose. Serve with eggs, fruit, and OJ for a complete meal.
    </p>
